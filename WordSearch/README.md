Project in C


Wanted to experiement with pointers and the use of recursion. Mainly, wanted to test my knowledge of computer orginization and how I was allocating my memory; hence the limited size given.

1. User inputs a number (call this N)
1a. This represents an NxN matrix.
2. Within this NxN matrix, user gets to input ONLY letters.
3. Program will then prommpt the user to find a specific word/letter they want to find specifically.
4. Program will find/will not find these letters/words based off connection
4a. This could be based off all 8 directions.
5. This will run recursively.
