Procedures of the Program

1. The program prompts the user with an input (this could be an array of numbers).

3. Next, the program will ask the user to input the amount of numbers to take away (from the original array).
 *Keep in mind that it will take the lowest numbers*
4. Lastly, the program will calculate the average with the numbers inputted in step 3.
